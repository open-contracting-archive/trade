# OCDS for Trade

A draft collection of Open Contracting Data Standard](http://standard.open-contracting.org) extensions and mappings designed for modeling and sharing data required by disclosures under the:

* EU Procurement Directives (revised directives)
* WTO Government Procurement Agreement
* UNCITRAL Model Procurement Law

Sponsored by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

## Status

This repository contains work-in-progress to develop:

* Mappings between the above frameworks and OCDS;
* Extensions to version 1.1 of OCDS to cover concepts and fields not available in OCDS core;
* Transformation and validation rules in relation to the above frameworks;
* Documentation on using OCDS for Trade as a tool when planning procurement data disclosure;

Extensions in this repository are **draft** and should not be used in production systems. 

When extensions are ready for use, they will be moved to their own respositories, and included in the [OCDS extensions registry](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/extensions/).
